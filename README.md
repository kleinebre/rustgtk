Welcome to the RustGTK repo
---------------------------

This is mostly boilerplate code testing out how to put
together user interfaces with Rust and GTK.

There are examples in src/examples/ and I have gradually
expanded these.

* src/examples/load_and_draw_on_pixbuf.rs

Loads an image from file into a pixbuf.
Draws pixels to the pixbuf. 
Creates an image widget from the pixbuf
Puts that image on a clickable button
